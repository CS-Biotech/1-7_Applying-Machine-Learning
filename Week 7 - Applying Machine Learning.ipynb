    "1. Data Preparation: In this step, we obtain the relevant data for the task we are trying to perform.\n",
    "2. Data Exploration: We then analyze the data at hand to manually find potentially interesting patterns.\n",
    "3. Model Training: Once we have explored our data and manually identified potential trends and patterns, we can train (aka fit) a machine learning model. Ideally, the ML model will pick up patterns we have missed and will be able to outperform rules we discover.\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation: To confirm if the model picked up useful trends, we will use a variety of metrics to evaluate how well the model does at our task.\n",

    "## Gene Expression Data for Acute Leukemia Patients\n",
    "In this module, we are going to analyze gene expression data for acure leukemia patients. Leukemia is a form of cancer that impacts the blood and bone marrow, interfering with the normal production and function of healthy blood cells. Within the bone marrow, blood stem cells, known as hematopoietic stem cells, generate different types of blood cells. Leukemia arises when these stem cells produce abnormal white blood cells, crowding out healthy cells and disrupting their functions. As a result, individuals with leukemia may become more prone to infections, experience anemia, or bleed easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its severity, it would be nice to be able to identify the type of leukemia a patient may have. To do this, [Golub et al. (1999)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10521349/) collected gene expression data from patients and aimed to use identify whether or not patients had either cute myeloid leukemia - AML - or acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL. Our goal is to use this data to create a classifier.\n",
